  ->Instead of blocking the specific app this app blocks every single app rendering your phone useless for every other purpose                    
  -> For example:
  If your most used application today is Instagram then,tommorow you can only access instagram for the entire day.Even the most basic fucntions like making a call is restricted.
  
### The Problem
If you are like me, You will probably like to Doom scrol for hours and hours without any external distractions from other apps.
just the thought that other apps existss in my phone makes me wanna stop doom scroling.
Who needs other apps when you are a Doom Scroller

### The Solution
Introducing Dead Inside:  
An app that blocks all other applications on your phone except the doom scroll application
